# linux-config

Configuration files and scripts to use for my Linux devices (currently on Arch Linux)

Each branch has its own `device-id` file, which identifies the device it is for.
Examples include "desktop" and "laptop"

As well, have a folder for secrets, known as "secrets", which is ignored by Git.

## Important commands

- `update` - Runs `paru` and `flatpak update`
- `update-config` - Updates the local copy of this repo, and the dotfiles associated with it

## Important scripts/programs
